    "A supervised learning algorithm is an algorithm that is able to learn from data. Now we need only to clarify what is data and what it means to learn?\n",

    "Let $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\mathcal{l}} \\subset \\mathbb{X} = \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\mathcal{l}} \\subset \\mathbb{Y}$. Here $\\mathbb{X}$ is the whole set of objects and $\\mathbb{Y}$ is all possible labels, so $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\mathcal{l}}$ is subset with known labels $\\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\mathcal{l}}$. We want to find algorithm, that can predict $y$ for any $x \\in \\mathbb{X}$. Actually, $x = (x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ is some vector of features (formal description), but $x^k$ can have different nature. \n",

    "### 3. Validation\n",
    "The data used to build the final model usually comes from multiple datasets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initially fit our parameters on a __training dataset__, that consists of pairs of a feature vector and the corresponding answer. The current model is run with the training dataset and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training dataset. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Second one called the __validation dataset__. The validation dataset provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning the model's hyperparameters (e.g. regularization coefficient or number of hidden units in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping: stop training when the error on the validation dataset increases, as this is a sign of overfitting to the training dataset. This simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset's error may fluctuate during training. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when overfitting has truly begun.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, the __test dataset__ is a dataset used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a validation technique for estimating how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice. The goal of cross validation is to limit problems like overfitting, give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation involves partitioning a sample of data into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset and making validation on the other. To reduce variability, multiple rounds of cross-validation are performed using different partitions, and the validation results are caveraged over the rounds to estimate a final predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are following types:\n",
    "1. Leave-p-out cross-validation - use p observations as the validation set with all possible ways.\n",
    "2. k-fold cross-validation - split data into k folds and use each one as validation set.\n",
    "3. Holdout validation - randomly split data into training and validation set\n",
    "4. Repeated random sub-sampling validation - repeatedly make random splits of data into training and validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercises\n",
    "1. Generate 20 validation samples\n",
    "2. Check quality of your model on train and validation sets.\n",
    "3. Have you experienced [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting)?\n",

    "### 5. Gradient descent\n",
    "Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. To find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent, one takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient of the function at the current point. Gradient descent is based on the observation that if function $Q(x)$ is defined and differentiable in a neighborhood of a point $x$, then $Q(x)$ decreases fastest if one goes from $x$  in the direction of the negative gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^{k+1} = x^{k} - \\lambda \\cdot \\triangledown Q(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\lambda$ is step of descent and  $k$ – step number. If $\\lambda$ is too large then algorithm may not converge, otherwise training can last a long time. Also there is rather popular hack to slowly decrease $\\lambda$ with each step. You need to understand that gradient descent finds exactly local minimum. The easiest way to fight this problem is make several runs of algorithm or have good initialization.\n",
